Dart and Flutter libraries

* [flutter_swap](packages/flutter_swap/) : the client library to load distant swap widgets from the server.
* [shelf_swap](packages/shelf_swap/) : a shelf handler to load a swap widget.
* [swap](packages/swap/) : the core swap widgets to use on server-side. Equivalent to the Flutter ones, but intented to be serialized as RFW widgets.
